Image classification Project


🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: Celebrity Image Classification! 🎉



I’ve been working on an exciting Computer vision project for my internship at CodeAlpha using Kaggle’s GPU (P100) to classify images of celebrities. Our dataset includes 17 celebrities, each with 100 images, except Scarlett Johansson, who has 200 images.
Hier our dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishesh1412/celebrity-face-image-dataset



Here’s a glimpse of the project:



🔧 **Tools & Libraries:**

- PyTorch for building and training the model

- torchvision for data transformation and augmentation

- OpenCV and PIL for image handling

- scikit-learn for label encoding



🏗️ **Approach:**

- Leveraged transfer learning with pre-trained models `EfficientNet_B7`

- Applied data augmentation techniques to improve model performance such as (Random Rotation, Color Jitter, Gaussian Blur, etc...)

- Used Adam optimizer and learning rate scheduler for training

- Achieving validation accuracy 93.5%



It’s been a fantastic learning experience, and I’m thrilled with the progress. Looking forward to sharing more details and results soon! 🚀
